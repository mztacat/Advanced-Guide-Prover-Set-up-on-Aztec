# Advanced-Guide-Prover-Set-up-on-Aztec
This guide provides a step-by-step, production-grade walkthrough for deploying and optimizing an Aztec Prover in a split-architecture configuration. Designed for operators, it covers everything from hardware selection and environment preparation to multi-server orchestration using Docker Compose.

# PLEASE TAKE NOTE! ! !  
## AZTEC SPECIFICALLY ANNOUCED YOU SHOULDN'T RUN NODE (PROVER/SEQUENCER) IN FOR AIRDROP EXPECTATIONS!
### RUN ONLY FOR THE TECH IF YOU CHOOSE TO OR SKIP!!! PASSING THAT INFO !

### The setup leverages a dedicated Broker + Prover Node server for coordination and proof publishing, and a high-performance agent rig for computation-heavy proving tasks. It includes:
  * Detailed hardware requirements and sizing recommendations for large-scale proving.
  * Docker Compose configurations for both broker and agent servers.
  * .env templates with clear variable descriptions.
  * Troubleshooting advice for common prover-node and agent issues.
### By following this guide, operators can maximize throughput, minimize downtime, and maintain a stable presence on the Aztec network, positioning themselves for optimal proof rewards in current and future network phases.

------
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**
> 
> - **Do NOT use the same private key** for your Prover as you do for a Sequencer Node as this will cause **nonce conflicts** and failed transactions.
> - **Do NOT run a Sequencer Node and a Prover on the same server** ‚Äî they use overlapping ports, which will result in **port binding conflicts**.

------
## 1. Preparation and Requirements 
- [ ] Read the [Aztec Prover Docs](https://docs.aztec.network/the_aztec_network/guides/run_nodes/how_to_run_prover)
- [ ] You'll need **two servers**: (these are my specifications for optimal performance)
  - **Broker Box** : 48‚Äì64 cores, 256 GB RAM, NVMe
  - **Main Rig (Agents)** : 64 - 192 cores, 256 ‚Äì 768 GB RAM, NVMe **( I used a 2x EPYC 96 Cores = 192 cores in total)**
- [ ] Take note of **public IP** for Broker NODE
- [ ] Open required ports on Broker Box:
  - `8081` (TCP)
  - `40400` (TCP & UDP)
- [ ] Install **Docker**, **Aztec CLI** & **Docker Compose v2** on both servers
- [ ] Generate a **Prover Publisher Private Key** and corresponding **Prover ID** (EVM address from private key)

## Getting Started 
## üöÄ Step 1 ‚Äî Set Up the Broker NODE

This server will run **two roles**:
- **Prover Broker** ‚Üí coordinates and assigns jobs to agents
- **Prover Node** ‚Üí fetches jobs, generates partial proofs, and submits final proofs
---
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Essentials
On the **Broker NODE** (48c/256 GB), update and install the required packages:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && \
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential \
    micro \
    libssl-dev \
    tar \
    unzip \
    wget \
    curl \
    git \
    jq \
    htop \
    ufw \
    net-tools \
    software-properties-common
```

### Install dependencies
```
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

### Add Docker‚Äôs official GPG key
```
sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | \
sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

### Set up repository
```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
  signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

### Install Docker Engine & Compose
```
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

### Verify installation
```
docker --version
docker compose version
```

------

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ üì• Install Aztec CLI
### Run the following command to install the **Aztec CLI** on your server:

```
bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)
```

### Add the CLI to your shell‚Äôs PATH:
```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.aztec/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### You can verify installation with: 
```
aztec --version 
```

### Update AZTEC to latest 
```
aztec-up latest
```
